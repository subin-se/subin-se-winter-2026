1月22日大英赛最新真题--翻译语料库
67. 每个新年伊始,我们许多人都会重新评估自己的健康习惯。我们试图继续保持那些行之有效的习惯,并改掉一些似乎妨碍我们成就“最佳自我”的习惯。但你可曾想过你所专注的是否是正确习惯?理想状态下,我们可以尝试我们读到或听说过的每种健康食物和运动,但大多数人在决定尝试什么时都不得不再三思量。正如同我们可能顾虑的,诸如锻炼、饮酒、抽烟这样的习惯均会影响寿命。
我的答案：
On the beginning of every new year, we will reaccess our healthy habits. We try to consist keeping those doing effective and getting rid of preventing us to be better. However, have you ever thought of the habits you addicted to is right habits? At the ideal condition, we can attempt to every healthy food and exercise we read and heard, but the majority of people have to think twice on what to try. As we may concerned, some habits like doing sports, drinking wine and smoking will affect lifelong.
参考答案：
The beginning of a new year is a time when many of us reassess our health habits. We try to keep those that work well and drop a few that seem to prevent us from becoming our "best self". But have you ever wondered if you're focusing on the right habits? In an ideal situation, we may try every kind of healthy food and activity that we read or hear about, but most of us have to think carefully about choosing what to pursue. Just as we might be concerned, habits like exercise, alcohol drinking, and smoking can all impact how long we live.、
我的理解：以句号为单位拆分再调整语序
1、第一句改为“每个新年都是我们许多人重新评估自己健康习惯的时候”。另外，assess  v.评估，用when引导的时间状语从句。
2、行之有效：work well；最佳自我：best self。
3、问句调整：But have you wondered if you are focusing on the right habits？
4、理想状态下：in an ideal situation。
5、再三思量：think carefully；饮酒：alcohol drinking。
6、均会影响寿命，调整为“均会影响我们能活多久”，用一个impact+how引导的宾语从句来收束全文。
